# OnHookLogger

**This mod is no longer being worked on!**
Work may continue in the future but I'm doubtful if I'll ever work on this in the future.

I'm not sure if the code in the `master` branch still works, but it probably works, but it doesn't contain the latest commits
done to OnHookLogger, for the latest commits see `improve-log` branch (which is still unfinished and non-functional)

Debug mod for Hollow Knight that logs all On. hook activities into a txt file
